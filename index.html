                    This visualization is <b><em>truthful</em></b> in the sense that it encodes all the information contained in the 
                    infrastructure bill into a single graphic. It displays the size of spending with shapes that are 
                    proportional to the spending allocations in the bill. This visualization is <b><em>functional</em></b> because the 
                    chart accurately depicts the data in a way that is clear allowing people to make comparisons across 
                    different spending categories in the infrastructure bill. Looking at this chart, readers are able to 
                    identify the big picture and view each aspect of the legislation in the context of other spending 
                    categories. The simplicity of the design and color choices makes this chart <b><em>beautiful</em></b>, drawing the reader 
                    in with its visual appeal. The chart is <b><em>insightful</em></b> because it displays each component of the bill as 
                    a part of the whole so readers are able to understand what spending categories are being prioritized 
                    by the Biden Administration. The chart helps break down a highly politicized and potentially confusing 
                    bill into categories that are quickly and easily understood by readers. The clarity of this chart can 
                    <b><em>enlighten</em></b> readers, changing their minds on the spending bill and encouraging them to engage more with 
                    its passing.
