                    This visualization is <b><em>truthful</em></b> in the sense that it encodes all the information contained in the 
                    infrastructure bill into a single graphic. It displays the size of spending with shapes that are 
                    proportional to the spending allocations in the bill. This visualization is <b><em>functional</em></b> because the 
                    chart accurately depicts the data in a way that is clear allowing people to make comparisons across 
                    different spending categories in the infrastructure bill. Looking at this chart, readers are able to 
                    identify the big picture and view each aspect of the legislation in the context of other spending 
                    categories. The simplicity of the design and color choices makes this chart <b><em>beautiful</em></b>, drawing the reader 
                    in with its visual appeal. The chart is <b><em>insightful</em></b> because it displays each component of the bill as 
                    a part of the whole so readers are able to understand what spending categories are being prioritized 
                    by the Biden Administration. The chart helps break down a highly politicized and potentially confusing 
                    bill into categories that are quickly and easily understood by readers. The clarity of this chart can 
                    <b><em>enlighten</em></b> readers, changing their minds on the spending bill and encouraging them to engage more with 
                    its passing.

                    The chart encodes three categories of water using the color channel. Each category of water is assigned a different 
                    shade of blue. The chart also uses the shape channel to mark 5 year increments along the chart. Additionally the chart uses 
                    poition channels. The x poition records the year (time) while the y position records renewable water per capita.

                    Above all, this visualization is <b><em>functional</em></b>. It breaks down the data in a way that allows viewers to 
                    easily recognize trends across categories of ice cream and countries where the ice cream is sold. Tooltips also 
                    contribute to functionality and decrease chart clutter by hiding less important details that the viewer can access by 
                    interacting with the chart. The clarity of the labels and simplicity of design make the chart <b><em>truthful</em></b> to 
                    the underlying data and no information is intentionally hidden from the reader. Additionally, the visualization is 
                    <b><em>beautiful</em></b> in the sense that it simplifies the data into an elegant and neat chart, encoding different

                    <span style="font-weight: bold">What makes this visualization bad?</span> <br> <br>
                    This visualization is bad because it is <b><em>untruthful</em></b>. As we can see the height of the bars is not 
                    correlated with the actual values above them. The highest value, 4,049 is written above the bar with the smallest value. 
                    In addition, the visualization also only includes data across the timespan of five days. Adding a wider range of values 
                    that cover a larger time period would make the visualization more effective at displaying the change in Coronavirus cases 
                    in Florida. Adding more data points would add more context to the chart making it easier to see the impact COVID-19 has 
                    had on the population of Florida. This visualization also does not have a visible x or y axis. In this case one can 
                    assume that the numbers on the bottom correlate to a given date, but it is not explicitly stated. The absence of the x 
                    axis also made it easier to mislead the audience by not using a scale to make the difference between the different 
                    values visible. The visualization is misleading because it appears that the lowest number of cases occurred on 6/19, 
                    which actually has the highest value. In general, the lack of context and scaling leads the visualization to lack 
                    <b><em>functionality</em></b> and its misleading nature means the visualization lacks meaningful <b><em>insight</em></b>.

                        This redesign uses the bar mark to encode the number of COVID-19 cases.

                    <p>
                        The redesign uses poition channels. The x poition records the date while the y position records the number of COVID-19 cases in the 
                        thousands. The color channel is also used to highlight elements in this chart when they are selected.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We believe this is the best redesign because it displays the data in context and the largest values correspond to the highest bar heights.
                        Additionally, the inclusion of x and y axes as well as an interactive tooltip that displays the date and number of COVID-19 cases makes
                        it easier for the viewer to quickly access the exact number of COVID-19 cases recorded on a single day. The original visualization did not 
                        show COVID-19 cases in context, so it was difficult for the viewer to understand the severity of the outbreak. Now viewers can recognize the

                        than the original design. Accurate bar heights display higher COVID-19 numbers with taller heights thus making this visualization more
                        <b><em>truthful</em></b> to the underlying data.

                        This redesign, like the first redesign, accurately encodes COVID-19 cases in the height of the bar. In this visualization the bar for 
                        6/19 is the tallest because the most COVID-19 cases (4,049) were observed on that day. The highest height corresponds to the highest 
                        number of cases making this visualizaiton more <b><em>truthful</em></b> to the underlying data. Labels on the bars
                        also allow users to quickly identify case numbers without having to refer to the y-axis. Additionally, a more cohesive color scheme
                        makes this chart more visually appearing adding to its <b><em>beauty</em></b>.

                    The visualzation encodes the average male height in meters from several countries.  <br> <br>
                    
                    This visualization is a variation bar chart: it replaces the bars with cartoon figures to make the chart 
                    more visually intersting, attracting the audience's attention. When viewing this chart, individuals are intended to 
                    compare average male height from 6 different countries around the world. Individuals can identify which countries 
                    have the tallest average male height and shortest average male height.

                    <span style="font-weight: bold">What makes this visualization bad?</span> <br> <br>
                    This visualization is bad because it is <b><em>untruthful</em></b>. When viewing this chart, individuals are led to 
                    belive that men from India and the Phillipines are significantly smaller than men from North America and Europe. 
                    The message is deceitful because in the graph the y-axis (heights) only range from 1.85 to 1.6. This limitted scale 
                    exagerates what would otherwise be more minor height differences by setting the y-axis baseline at 1.5m instead of 0m. 
                    Visually, this chart does not make sense because each figure is standing on the ground which assumes a baseline of 0. 
                    Therefore, not only is the chart confusing because it features figures standing on the ground (0m baseline) while the 
                    y-axis starts at 1.5m, but the chart also intentionally makes the Indian and Filipino figures much smaller and shorter, 
                    which misleads the audience.

                        We think that this is the best redesign. The primary difference between this visualization and the original 
                        is that our redesign sets 0 as the baseline for the y-axis. This scaling makes the redesign is more 
                        <b><em>truthful</em></b> since it more accurately displays differences in height. The redesign keeps the most 
                        interesting feature of the original visualization, which is the use of cartoon figures, but it displays the data 
                        in a way that allows viewers to draw meaningful conclusions.

                        This redesign is similar to the first redesign except it rectangles to encode the height instead of cartoon
                        characters. Like the first redesign, this chart uses a baseline of 0 to more acurately depict differences in 
                        height. Unlike the first chart, this redesign eliminates the cartoon characters. Although the elimination of 
                        the cartoons makes chart simpler, it does eliminate some of the context the cartoon figures provide (looking
                        at the first chart the viewer can quickly conclude that we are comparing male height). Most importantly this 
                        redesign (like the first redesign) is <b><em>truthful</em></b>, accurately displaying the data.

                    This visualization is bad because the size of the bubbles is misleading. The difference between the values is not 
                    proportional to the difference in size between the bubbles. It also is somewhat difficult to see where on the circle 
                    lines up with the y axis, so the value of the production budget is not obvious to the viewer. One might assume that 
                    the center of the circle is where the value of the production budget is, but this is not explicitly stated to the 
                    viewer. Using bubbles to represent this data does not appear to be the most effective way to demonstrate the 
                    relationship between production budget and total gross for different movies. For these reasons, this visualization is 
                    not <b><em>truthful</em></b> because it is misleading and it is not <b><em>functional</em></b> because it is built in 
                    a way that makes it difficult for the viewer to make conclusions and compare values in a meaningful way.

                        is recorded on the x-axis and production budget in millions is recorded on the y-axis.

                        We believe this redesign is the best redesign because it allows viewers to make comparisons between production cost and the amount of money
                        each movie grossed. Because the data compares two quantitative values it makes sense to display the information in a scatter plot. This 
                        design also helps viewers easily identify the outlier (Titanic) in top grossing movies. The interactive tooltip also allows viewers to expand
                        the data and view it with more detail. In general, this redesign makes the data quickly understandable adding to its <b><em>functionality</em></b>.

                        This chart uses the color channel to highlight a selected movie. This chart also uses the position channel. Total amount grossed in billions
                        is recorded on the y-axis and movie is recorded on the x-axis.

                        This redesign focuses more heavily on the total amount grossed by each movie as that is the subject of the chart. Like the scatterplot the bar
                        chart layout allows viewers to recognize the outlier in the data and make comparisons between the highest grossing movie and the lowest grossing
                        movie in this list. Most of the details are hidden in the tooltip which the user can interact with to reveal information about production budget, 
                        amount grossed, and the year the movie was released. Although these new features make the new visualizaiton more <b><em>functional</em></b> 
                        viewers are not as easily able to make comparisons between production cost and total amount grossed at first glance.
